# Healthcare-Analytics


You are a data analyst at a national healthcare oversight organization. Youâ€™ve been given access to a dataset of 55,500 unique patient records from 10 major hospitals across the U.S. The dataset captures a broad view of hospital admissions, medical conditions, medications, insurance providers, and treatment costs. Your goal is to uncover insights that can drive better healthcare decisions, optimize costs, and improve patient outcomes. Create a compelling Power BI dashboard that tells the story of patient care across hospitals, identifies trends, and helps stakeholders make data-informed decisions.

 

Key Questions to Answer in Your Analysis:

1.   What are the most common age groups, genders, and blood types among patients? Are certain groups being admitted more often than others?
2.   Which medical conditions are diagnosed the most, and do they affect certain groups of people more than others?
3.   How long do patients typically stay in the hospital for different conditions? Does this vary depending on the hospital or type of admission (emergency, urgent, or planned)?
4.   How much does treatment usually cost for each condition? Are there big differences in costs between hospitals or insurance providers?
5.   Which hospitals are treating the most patients, and how do they compare in terms of patient outcomes, like test results?
6.   What medications are most often prescribed for each condition? Are they being used consistently across hospitals?
7.   How are patients admitted - mostly through emergency, urgent, or planned admissions - and how does that impact the length of stay or treatment costs?
8.   Which insurance companies are covering the most patients, and how does that relate to treatment costs and patient outcomes?
9.   Where are the hospitals located, and are there any regional differences in health conditions, treatment quality, or billing amounts?
